            <h1>Why SQL?</h1>
Nowadays, SQL is widely used in data science and analytics. Following are the reasons which explain why it is widely used:

The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update, and delete the data from the relational database.
SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the data from the relational database management systems.
It also helps them to describe the structured data.
It allows SQL users to create, drop, and manipulate the database and its tables.
It also helps in creating the view, stored procedure, and functions in the relational database.
It allows you to define the data and modify that stored data in the relational database.
It also allows SQL users to set the permissions or constraints on table columns, views, and stored procedures.
History of SQL
"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" was a paper which was published by the great computer scientist "E.F. Codd" in 1970.

The IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed the SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) after learning from the paper given by E.F. Codd. They both developed the SQL at the San Jose Research laboratory of IBM Corporation in 1970.

At the end of the 1970s, relational software Inc. developed their own first SQL using the concepts of E.F. Codd, Raymond Boyce, and Donald Chamberlin. This SQL was totally based on RDBMS. Relational Software Inc., which is now known as Oracle Corporation, introduced the Oracle V2 in June 1979, which is the first implementation of SQL language. This Oracle V2 version operates on VAX computers.


Process of SQL
When we are executing the command of SQL on any Relational database management system, then the system automatically finds the best routine to carry out our request, and the SQL engine determines how to interpret that particular command.


Structured Query Language contains the following four components in its process:

Query Dispatcher
Optimization Engines
Classic Query Engine
SQL Query Engine, etc.
A classic query engine allows data professionals and users to maintain non-SQL queries. The architecture of SQL is shown in the following diagram:</div>
